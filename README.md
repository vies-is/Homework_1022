Overview:
Project is result for first major assignment of DIP221 course at RTU.
It's focused on developing initial and first-hand experience with HTML, with some steps in CSS.

On theme:
Theme was dictated by small music festival I've really enjoyed in the past and hope for this experience to continue.
It was particularly interesting due to the absence of an official festival webpage, if accounts on social platforms are not considered.

Disclaimers:
Page is not in any means connected to organisers.
I'm not an owner of any of the images or documents used and have added original sources.
Please inform me in case of complains.
